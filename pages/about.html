	<h1 style="color:red;">Love Story of Prophet Muhammad And Aisha</h1>
	<p style="color:yellow; background:black;">This is the true love story of Muhammad (Peace and blessing be upon him) and his wife Aishah (May Allah be pleased with her). They had the real thing, love, romance, and true happiness.</p>
	<h2 style="color:pin;">Despite his enormous responsibilities, Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) always found time for laughter and kind words of affection. He raced her once and she won and made a fuss about it a while later, she gained some weight and raced him again. This time he won and said while laughing “This makes us even”</h2>

	<p style="color:green;">That leader found time for the little things. He used to turn her glass of water around searching for the trace of her lips to drink after her. She used to cut his hair and groom him. They kissed before he leaves the house and he brought her presents.

On an expedition she was with him and lost her necklace, so he stopped the army to look for it.

Prophet Muhammad (PBUH)  used her nickname everywhere all the time and he was not shy to show his affection towards her in the most respecting and honoring way.

He forgave her jealous nature and flaws and made excuses for her.</p>
